## How to use

* Enter time as follows: `6h`, `6h30m`
* Press enter
* Enjoy the timer. The timer is **always on top** of other windows. It doesn't fold unless you **really** want it, so you will always see it. As long as it's green and ticking you have to work.
* Press the button to pause if you go to restroom
* When the timer passes, one can hear the OS signals every second. It's over now, take the rest and enjoy the wage

## Build

Java 11 is required for the build and run

`./gradlew clean fatJar`

Then run with java

`java -jar wageslave-timer-0.1-alpha.jar`

## Plans

* Make resizable
* Better styling
* Make font configurable
